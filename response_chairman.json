It does well in terms of simplicity and directness, making it easy to understand. However, it does poorly in terms of providing additional context or emphasis on the importance of Paris as the capital.\n\nResponse B is similar to Response A, offering the same basic and correct information. Like Response A, it excels in simplicity but lacks any depth or unique presentation of the information. It neither particularly excels nor fails in any significant way, making it a middle-of-the-road response.\n\nResponse C stands out by emphasizing the answer (**Paris**) through bold formatting, which can draw attention to the key piece of information being asked for. This emphasis can be particularly useful in text-based responses where visual cues can enhance understanding and engagement. However, like Responses A and B, it does not provide any additional context about Paris or its significance as the capital of France.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response C\n2. Response A\n3.

It concisely answers the question without providing any unnecessary details. However, it falls short because the answer lacks emphasis and does not stand out, making it potentially harder to read or understand, especially in a large amount of written text.\n\nResponse B:\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\nSimilar to Response A, Response B does well in providing the accurate answer to the question without any extraneous information. Like Response A, it is also overly brief and might be easily overlooked or forgotten, especially when multiple pieces of information are presented.\n\nResponse C:\nThe capital of France is **Paris**.\n\nResponse C excels by making the answer stand out from the rest of the text, thanks to the bold formatting of the city name. This formatting draws the reader's attention directly to the answer, making it more prominent and easier to focus on.
